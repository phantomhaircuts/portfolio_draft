                        A generative audio project, the intention was to create an object that would serve as a music
                        making device. The end deliverable was a 3D printed planter that housed an arduino, one input
                        used a ecg shield connected to the leaves of the plant, the output was connected to a
                        Streichfett polyphonic synthesizer. The end result took the eletrical impulses from the plant,
                        translated that into midi information, and sent the midi to the snythesizer which was connected
                        to powered speakers. The plants would generate a tone, which could be manipulated by interaction
                        of the user, encouraging interaction and creating a feedback loop with an object which is
                        usually simply decorative.

                        One of the main challenges was determining how to create an object that would still be
                        autonomous [not requiring any interaction] while still remaining playful and enticing to
                        facilitate interaction.
                        There were many iterations to the design, ultimately I decided on an organic looking support
                        legs playing up the interaction of life and technology.

                        The process involved a lot of trial and error, making sure the cavity at the bottom was big
                        enough to the arduino and the i/o was a challenge.

                        While this was a fun and rudimentary exploration of generative sound, I like to focus on the
                        timbre and the sonic characteristics that are conveyed. It would be interesting if other
                        atmospheric or temporal conditions could somehow act as modifiers on the sound. Ultimately it
                        would be advantageous to have the synthesizer as well as the speaker all be self contained
                        within the planter.
